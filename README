XangaScrape

So Xanga is shutting down(?) so here's a quick and ugly program I wrote to
download your site. Yes, I know they're providing downloads for an archived
version of your site, but they're limited and ugly. You can also download other
people's sites too (as long as they are not private). This program should
download all the pages as you would normally see them, as well as comments
pages. I used java because the HtmlUnit library is pretty easy to use for these
kinds of things.

What you need: 
java (you probably have it) 
optional: bash/sed. If you're on Mac OS X/Linux you probably have it. If you
have Windows you probably can get it working with some work.  Just google for
bash and sed for windows. Bash/sed is used for some funny pattern matching to
fix some of the links in the downloaded html files because I figured it's
easier to write it that way.

Run the jar file with: java -jar XangaScrape.jar in the terminal/command prompt
or double click on the .bat (Windows) or .sh (Mac) files.

Downloaded files will be found in the "posts" directory.

No license, do whatever you want with it.
